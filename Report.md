## Questions

1. Why does your program need a setup and a loop?

    There needs to be an area of code that is only run once and a segment of code that loops forever.

2. What is the downside to putting all your code in a loop?

    The code would be harder to manage if all the code including variable were re-initialized. The program would also 
	perform worse if it repeated all lines of code. 

3. Why does your code need to be compiled?

    Code needs to be complied because the code that we write needs to be translated into assembly language and then into binary 
	that the computer can understand.

4. When lowering the frequency in procedure A, step 4, what is going wrong? Brainstorm some solutions. Dimmers exist in the real world. What is their solution?
